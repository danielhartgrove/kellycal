# KellyCal, Simple Calorie Counting Application

KellyCal is currently in development, but will eventually:
- Allow you to calculate nutritional macros from your personal saved record
- Upload, edit and add to a daily log of the food you've eaten
- Keep track of the food that you've eaten in the past.
- Calculate how many calories, grams of protein or other macronutrients you have left for the day
- Allow you to check in to keep a track of how often you're losing weight
- See a breakdown of all of your stats

KellyCal is the perfect project for me to learn PHP and show of my ability to manage a project using GIT. Eventually, I hope to publish KellyCal online.
